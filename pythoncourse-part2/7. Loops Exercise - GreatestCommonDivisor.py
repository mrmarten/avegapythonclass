Exercise : Greatest Common Divisor

The greatest common divisor of two positive integers, n and m, is the largest number,
d, which divides evenly into both n and m. There are several algorithms that can be
used to solve this problem, including:
Initialize d to the smaller of m and n.
While d does not evenly divide m or d does not evenly divide n do
Decrease the value of d by 1
Report d as the greatest common divisor of n and m
Write a program that reads two positive integers from the user and uses this algorithm
to determine and report their greatest common divisor.

# Solution to Exercise : Greatest Common Divisor
##
# Compute the greatest common divisor of two positive integers using a while loop.
#
# Read two positive integers from the user
n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
m = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
# Initialize d to the smaller of n and m
d = min(n, m)
# Use a while loop to find the greatest common divisor of n and m
while n % d != 0 or m % d != 0:
    d = d - 1
# Report the result
print("The greatest common divisor of", n, "and", m, "is", d)
