Exercise: Shuffling a Deck of Cards

A standard deck of playing cards contains 52 cards. Each card has one of four suits
along with a value. The suits are normally spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs while
the values are 2 through 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace.


Each playing card can be represented using two characters. The first character is
the value of the card, with the values 2 through 9 being represented directly. The
characters “T”, “J”, “Q”, “K” and “A” are used to represent the values 10, Jack,
Queen, King and Ace respectively. The second character is used to represent the suit
of the card. It is normally a lowercase letter: “s” for spades, “h” for hearts, “d” for
diamonds and “c” for clubs. The following table provides several examples of cards
and their two-character representations.

Card Abbreviation
Jack of spades Js
Two of clubs 2c
Ten of diamonds Td
Ace of hearts Ah
Nine of spades 9s

Begin by writing a function named createDeck. It will use loops to create a
complete deck of cards by storing the two-character abbreviations for all 52 cards
into a list. Return the list of cards as the function’s only result. Your function will
not require any parameters.

Write a second function named shuffle that randomizes the order of the cards
in a list. One technique that can be used to shuffle the cards is to visit each element
in the list and swap it with another random element in the list. You must write your
own loop for shuffling the cards. You cannot make use of Python’s built-in shuffle
function.

Use both of the functions described in the previous paragraphs to create a main
program that displays a deck of cards before and after it has been shuffled. Ensure
that your main program only runs when your functions have not been imported into
another file.

A good shuffling algorithm is unbiased, meaning that every different arrangement
of the elements is equally probable when the algorithm completes. While
the approach described earlier in this problem suggested visiting each element
in sequence and swapping it with an element at a random index, such an algorithm
is biased. In particular, elements that appear later in the original list are
more likely to end up later in the shuffled list. 

Counterintuitively, an unbiased
shuffle can be achieved by visiting each element in sequence and swapping it
to a random index between the position of the current element and the end of
the list instead of randomly selecting any index.

##
# Create a deck of cards and shuffle it.

            # Construct the card and add it to the list
            cards.append(value + suit)

        temp = cards[i]
        cards[i] = cards[other_pos]
        cards[other_pos] = temp
