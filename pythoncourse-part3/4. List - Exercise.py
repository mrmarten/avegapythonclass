# Solution to Exercise: Random Lottery Numbers
##
# Compute random but distinct numbers for a lottery ticket.
#
from random import randrange
# Using constants makes it easy to reconfigure
# our program for other lotteries.
MIN_NUM = 1
MAX_NUM = 49
NUM_NUMS = 6
# Use a list to store the numbers on the ticket
ticket_nums = []
# Generate NUM NUMS random but distinct numbers
for i in range(NUM_NUMS):
    # Generate a number that isnâ€™t already on the ticket
    rand = randrange(MIN_NUM, MAX_NUM + 1)
    while rand in ticket_nums:
        rand = randrange(MIN_NUM, MAX_NUM + 1)
# Add the number to the ticket
    ticket_nums.append(rand)
# Sort the numbers into ascending order and display them
ticket_nums.sort()
print("Your numbers are: ", end="")
for n in ticket_nums:
    print(n, end=" ")
print()
